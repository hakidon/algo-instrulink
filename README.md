## Project Title
**INSTRULINK** is a blockchain based project developed on algorand network

## Project Description
The whole idea of this project is to enable end consumers to verify the authenticity of the instruments they are going to buy with ease. The registered instrument would be included with a QR code, which the end user could simply scan to verify the instrument's authenticity sold by distributors. When the instruments are allotted from manufacturer to other distributors, ownership transactions must be performed on the blockchain network via verified wallet account. The system will keep track of the transactions record thus ensuring the instruments' legitimacy and the ownership transparency. 

### Features available
